Norms are a measure of distance. Norm is defined as follows:

For $p\geq1$,

$$||x||_p \equiv \sqrt[p]{|x_1|^p + |x_2|^p + ... + |x_n|^p}$$

## Euclidean Norm (2-Norm)

It is the most common notion of distance. When $p=2$, then the norm is said to
be euclidean norm.

$$||x||_2 \equiv \sqrt{|x_1|^2 + |x_2|^2 + ... + |x_n|^2}$$

## Taxicab Norm (1-Norm)

When $p=1$, then the norm is said to be taxicab norm. The distance derived from
this norm is called Manhattan distance.

$$||x||_1 \equiv |x_1| + |x_2| + ... + |x_n|$$
