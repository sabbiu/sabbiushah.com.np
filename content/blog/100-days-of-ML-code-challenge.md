I am getting started on #100DaysOfMLCode Challenge by [Siraj Raval](https://twitter.com/sirajraval). My aim here is to gain an understanding of various AI algorithms and techniques such as Neural Networks, GAN, Autoencoders, RNN and so on... My focus will be mostly on Deep Learning part of Artificial Intelligence.

I have already taken few courses in Machine Learning surfacially. I have also taken 3blue1brown's [Essence of Linear Algebra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab) and a coursera course [Mathematics for Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mathematics-machine-learning). I have already completed Andrew Ng's [deeplearning.ai](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) course, but I need to revisit this.

So, my plan is to start by revising [deeplearning.ai](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) course from coursera followed by course on [Advanced Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/aml) and see where it goes. I also plan to write a blog about everything I learn.
